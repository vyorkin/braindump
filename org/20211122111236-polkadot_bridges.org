* InterBTC (aka PolkaBTC) by Interlay

[[https://bridge.interlay.io/bridge?tab=issue][InterBTC bridge]] is a decentralized bridge based on the [[https://www.xclaim.io/][XCLAIM]]
protocol. The corresponding assets are 1:1 bitcoin-backed. There
are actually two bridges:

- BTC ↔ Polkadot (WIP)
- BTC ↔ Kusama [[https://kintsugi.interlay.io/][Kintsugi]]

To mint interBTC, users lock BTC with custodians (vaults).
Vaults are not trusted. They must lock collateral in various
assets, such as DAI, DOT, USDC, with the interBTC bridge (the
Interlay parachain on Polkadot). If a Vault steals or loses BTC,
their collateral is slashed — and users reimbursed.

** Kintsugi

[[https://kintsugi.interlay.io/][Kintsugi]] is the canary network (parachain) on Kusama.

* Snowbridge by Snowfork

[[https://github.com/Snowfork/snowbridge][Snowbridge]] is a general purpose, trustless and decentralized
bridge between Polkadot and Ethereum. It will enable not only
ETH to be transferred from Ethereum to Polkadot, but also ERC20
assets and arbitrary data. Beyond asset transfer, the bridge can
be used for much more sophisticated interactions such as
cross-chain smart contract calls.
